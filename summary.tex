{\bf Overview}~~

Despite arguably being simple in nature to defend, there exist no tools to defend againsts them. While anti-phishing research has flourished due to plentiful access to data... samething has not happened to interactive social engineering attacks...

%Our project is structured in the form of three research thrusts that assume different vantage points in the bot farm attack pipeline to help measure and mitigate bot ataks.

\BfPara{Thrust-1: Scam baiter studies}

% This includes initial qualitative research to create a first-of-its-kind taxonomic classification of in-the-wild bot attacks.
%The follow-up activity in this thrust that extends till the end of the project period is to deploy the framework and subject the data to a mixed-methods analysis that combines inital qualitative research methods for a first of its kind taxonomical categorization of in-the-wild bot attacks. This will be complemented with scalable predictive ML approaches for longitudinal insights into real world bot threat patterns.
